-> APPIUM is open SOURCE
-> APPIUM is a server
-> You can do automation on mobile apps, web apps and desktop apps through Appium.
-> Java -- Selenium -- Browser
-> Java -- Appium -- Mobile app
-> Appium is the middle man in the scenario.
-> We talk with the Appium to talk with the real device or emulator/simulator. Like an API. (between java,methods and real device/emulator/simulator).
-> API request.
-> Appium is taking our API request and send it to app to execute.
-> Our job is telling Appium to run the mobile apps.
-> Appium concepts: purely REST API.
-> Desired Capabilities: are a set of keys and values(like a map) sent to the Appium server to tell the server what kind of automation session we are interested in starting up.
	ex. Desired Capabilities {
		platform name: '...',
		platform version: '...'.
		...
	}
-> Where this server is running? In the nodeJS. What is nodeJS? : It is like an environment as JVM for Java. Appium is using JS nodeJS environment and running and waiting our requests.
-> appinfo.apk file
-> Ä°d is not always unique, like name. If you find accessbility id, then it is good to go! It is like "id" in front-end selenium.
-> Appium Inspector, id is not always unique, accessbilityId is always unique.
-> Before run a test case, you should always close Appium Inspector. Otherwise Appium Server will listen Appium Inspector, not you(Intellij/Selenium)
